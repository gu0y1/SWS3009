# Group 11

**Objective:** Develop a robot that can detect a baby’s mood and take appropriate actions to keep the baby happy. The robot should also maintain a safe distance from the baby using an ultrasonic sensor.

#### Deep Learning:

1. **Mood Detection:**
   * **Task:** Detect the baby’s mood (happy, sleepy, or unhappy).
   * **Implementation:** Train a deep learning model to recognize the baby’s mood based on visual and audio inputs.
   * **Friday Deadline:** Ensure the mood detection model is functional by Friday.

#### Actions Based on Mood:

1. **Sleepy:**
   * **Task:** Play soothing music.
   * **Implementation:** Integrate a music playback system that activates when the baby is detected as sleepy.
2. **Happy:**
   * **Task:** Activate a baby mobile.
   * **Implementation:** Design a mechanism to turn on a baby mobile to entertain the baby when detected as happy.
3. **Unhappy:**
   * **Task:** Perform actions to cheer up the baby.
   * **Implementation:** Add mechanical arms that can dance or perform gestures to make the baby happy.

#### Robotics and Hardware:

1. **Mechanical Arms:**
   * **Task:** Design and implement mechanical arms that can dance or gesture.
   * **Friday Deadline:** Ensure the mechanical arms are functional by Friday.
2. **Safety Distance Maintenance:**
   * **Task:** Maintain a safe distance from the baby using an ultrasonic sensor.
   * **Implementation:** Integrate ultrasonic sensors to continuously monitor the distance between the robot and the baby, adjusting the robot’s position as needed.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Deep Learning Development:**
   * **Dataset Collection:** Collect and annotate data of babies’ different moods.
   * **Model Training:** Train a deep learning model to accurately detect the baby’s mood.
   * **Model Validation:** Test the model to ensure it reliably detects moods.
2. **Robotics Development:**
   * **Mechanical Arms:** Design, build, and test mechanical arms for dancing and gesturing.
   * **Music Playback:** Integrate a system for playing soothing music.
   * **Baby Mobile Activation:** Design a mechanism to activate the baby mobile.
3. **Safety System:**
   * **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Install and calibrate ultrasonic sensors to maintain a safe distance from the baby.
   * **Integration:** Ensure the sensor data is used to adjust the robot’s movements to avoid getting too close to the baby.

#### Next Steps for Students:

1. **Deep Learning Tasks:**
   * **Dataset Preparation:** Collect and label data for different baby moods.
   * **Model Training:** Train the mood detection model and ensure it is accurate and reliable.
   * **Validation:** Validate the model with real-world tests.
2. **Robotics Tasks:**
   * **Mechanical Arms:** Complete the design and functionality of the mechanical arms for dancing and gestures.
   * **Music and Mobile Systems:** Integrate and test the music playback and baby mobile activation mechanisms.
3. **Safety Tasks:**
   * **Sensor Integration:** Ensure ultrasonic sensors are correctly installed and integrated with the robot’s control system.
   * **Safety Testing:** Test the robot’s ability to maintain a safe distance from the baby.

#### Final Considerations:

* **Safety First:** Prioritize the baby’s safety by ensuring the robot maintains a safe distance at all times.
* **System Reliability:** Focus on creating a reliable system for mood detection and appropriate responses.
* **User-Friendly Design:** Ensure the system is easy to use and adjust as needed for different babies and environments.

#### Summary:

* Develop a deep learning model to detect baby moods and integrate it with a robot.
* Design mechanical arms for dancing and other gestures to cheer up the baby.
* Implement systems to play soothing music and activate a baby mobile based on the baby’s mood.
* Ensure the robot maintains a safe distance from the baby using ultrasonic sensors.
* Meet the deadlines for functional mood detection and mechanical arms by Friday.
